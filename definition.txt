A bot is a software application that is programmed to do certain tasks. 
Bots are automated, which means they run according to their instructions without a human user needing to manually start them up every time. 
Bots often imitate or replace a human user's behavior. 
Typically they do repetitive tasks, and they can do them much faster than human users could.
